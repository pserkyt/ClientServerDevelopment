# ClientServerDevelopment

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

By writing code modularly in functions and classes, code is easily reusable in multiple projects. The best examples of this are libraries such as the built-in python libraries pandas (Python Data Analysis Library) and Dash. To increase maintainability and readability code must be well commented.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

For this project I started by learning how to use the Dash library. Without understanding Dash, there was no chance of me understanding what the code was doing. After reading the Dash documentation I could look at the code and completely understand what the code did and I was easily able to integrade my CRUD module and solve the problem at hand. I believe I use the same stragegy for other programming projects: as long as I can understand the code I can adapt it to solve the problem.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve problems by utilizing computer technology to create solutions for a variety of industries. Grazioso Salvare is an animal rescue company, not a technolog company, so computer scientists help fill the technology gap to bring companies into the technological future. Rather than sorting through tons of paperwork to find an appropriate rescue animal, it takes seconds using MongoDB and the python dashboard.
